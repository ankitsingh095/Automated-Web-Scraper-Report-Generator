you should  have BloodBank data -
include **sample scraped data + pre-generated Excel report** inside the repo so recruiters can see results immediately, even without running the scraper


# Automated Web Scraper & Report Generator - Blood Bank Portal

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **integrated system** built with **Python, Scrapy, Pandas, Django, and Bootstrap**.  
It automates donor data collection, manages blood bank requests, and generates analytical reports.

### 🚀 Features

- 🧑‍💻 **Django + Bootstrap Portal** → Donor registration, search, and blood request management (reduced manual work by 60%).  
- 📊 **Excel Reports with Pandas** → Automated reports for donor distribution and request summaries.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scrapy**
- **Django**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Pandas** (Excel automation)

---

## ⚡ How It Works
1. **Scraper (`scraper/`)** → Extracts donor data from mock HTML/JSON and saves to `scraper/output/donors.json`.  
2. **Portal (`bloodbank/`)** → Django web app with donor registration, search, and request modules.  
3. **Report Generator (`report_generator.py`)** → Uses Pandas to create `reports/donor_report.xlsx` with insights.

## 📊 Sample Output
- Donor Data → `scraper/output/donors.json`
- Excel Report → `reports/donor_report.xlsx`

---

## 💡 Talking Points
- Integrated **scraper + portal + reports** into one workflow.  
- Optimized manual donor data processing time by **60%**.
